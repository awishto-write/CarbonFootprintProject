# Simply Green Lenses: CarbonFootprintProject

# Inspiration

Climate change is a phenomenon that affects everyone everywhere. The recent extra hot weather during the Summer and the weatherâ€™s constant changing from minute to minute has been even worse than it has ever been before, which is concerning. Even the air during morning walks is sometimes hard to breathe. Not to mention all the alarming statistics about the consequences of climate change that arose every day. So, having a web application that educates us about our carbon footprints and greenhouse gases (GHG) is more than needed.
         
# What it does
Simply Green Lenses educates people about the problems that the environment and all living creatures are facing. It calculates an individual's carbon footprints to inform the individual about his contributions to the greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) It also provides solutions to help us reduce GHG.

# What's next for Simply Green Lenses
Allowing users to compare their carbon footprint to other users of the site, a chat feature allowing users to schedule things such as carpools, and a catalog feature where users can update their activities daily and see a day-to-day report of their carbon emissions. It would be nice to use Lens Studio to build and create Lenses (back-facing and front-facing cameras) that inspire people to take care of the environment and make them happy to be in a clean and beautiful environment. Simple nature lenses that people of different ages can have on their phones to see what the environment that is taken care of looks like.
